The model uses a complex deep learning model to build an embedding layer followed by a classification algorithm to analyse the sentiment of the customers.\n","#**DATA DESCRIPTION:** \n","The Dataset of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labelled by sentiment (positive/negative). Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers). For convenience, the words are indexed by their frequency in the dataset, meaning the for that has index 1 is the most frequent word. Use the first 20 words from each review to speed up training, using a max vocabulary size of 10,000. As a convention, \"0\" does not stand for a specific word, but instead is used to encode any unknown word.\n","#**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:** \n","Build a sequential NLP classifier which can use input text parameters to determine the customer sentiments.\n","\n","#**STEPS AND TASKS:** [ Total Score: 30 points]\n","1. Import and analyse the data set.\n","  * Hint: - Use `imdb.load_data()` method\n","    * Get train and test set\n","    * Take 10000 most frequent words\n","2. Perform relevant sequence adding on the data\n","3. Perform following data analysis:\n","  * Print shape of features and labels\n","  * Print value of any one feature and it's label\n","4. Decode the feature value to get original sentence\n","5. Design, train, tune and test a sequential model.\n","  * Hint: The aim here Is to import the text, process it such a way that it can be taken as an inout to the ML/NN\n","classifiers. Be analytical and experimental here in trying new approaches to design the best model.\n","6.
